## Summary

Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard that tracks USDC/USDT flows between major centralized exchanges (CEXs) and DeFi protocols to identify institutional money movement patterns.

## Features Implemented

### 📊 Flow Volume Chart
- Time series visualization of daily net flows (CEX → DeFi vs DeFi → CEX)
- 30-day lookback period with stacked area chart
- Separate visualization for USDC and USDT flows

### 🔝 Top Movers Table
- Displays largest single transfers over $10M from the last 7 days
- Detailed transaction information: Date, Amount, From, To, Token type
- Sorted by transfer size

### 📈 Correlation Analysis
- Scatter plot showing relationship between net stablecoin inflows and ETH price changes
- 48-hour lag analysis to identify leading indicators
- Pearson correlation coefficient with interpretation guide
- Includes trend line visualization

### 🏦 Protocol Breakdown
- Horizontal bar chart of total inflows by destination protocol
- Tracks major DeFi protocols: Aave, Compound, Curve, Uniswap
- Last 30 days aggregated data

### 💡 Automated Insights
- Dynamic 2-3 sentence summary at dashboard top
- Analyzes net flow direction and recent trends
- Highlights correlation strength and ETH price movements

## Technical Implementation

**Stack:**
- Streamlit for dashboard UI
- pandas for data processing
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Dune Analytics API for blockchain data
- CoinGecko API for ETH prices

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Works without API keys (uses mock data for testing)
- ✅ Production-ready with error handling and caching
- ✅ Railway deployment configured
- ✅ Clean, professional UI
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## Files Added

- `stablecoin_dashboard.py` - Main dashboard application
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies
- `README.md` - Setup and usage instructions
- `Procfile` - Railway start command
- `railway.toml` - Railway deployment config
- `runtime.txt` - Python version specification
- `.gitignore` - Python/Streamlit artifacts

## Test Plan

### Local Testing
- [ ] Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- [ ] Run dashboard: `streamlit run stablecoin_dashboard.py`
- [ ] Verify dashboard opens at http://localhost:8501
- [ ] Confirm all 4 visualizations render correctly
- [ ] Check that mock data loads without API keys
- [ ] Verify insights summary displays at top

### Railway Deployment
- [ ] Verify Railway deployment succeeds with new Procfile
- [ ] Confirm dashboard is accessible via Railway URL
- [ ] Test that mock data works in production environment
- [ ] Optionally: Add DUNE_API_KEY environment variable for real data

### Data Validation
- [ ] Verify flow volume chart shows 30-day history
- [ ] Check Top Movers table filters transfers > $10M
- [ ] Confirm correlation analysis displays coefficient
- [ ] Ensure protocol breakdown shows all major protocols

## Deployment Notes

**Railway Configuration:**
- Uses Python 3.11 runtime
- Streamlit configured for Railway's dynamic port binding
- Runs in headless mode (no browser launch)
- Auto-restart on failure

**Environment Variables (Optional):**
- `DUNE_API_KEY` - For real blockchain data (falls back to mock data if not set)

## How to Run

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run locally
streamlit run stablecoin_dashboard.py
```

The dashboard works immediately with mock data - no configuration required!

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
- Add more CEXs and protocols
- Include additional stablecoins (DAI, FRAX)
- Historical comparison features
- Alert system for unusual patterns
- CSV export functionality
